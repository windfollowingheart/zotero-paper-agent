# 3.0 Plugin Introduction

The 3.0 version includes the following optimizations:

- Optimized UI with support for `dark` and `light` mode switching.
- Integrated model API that supports calls in the `openai` format.
- Retained `kimi` while removing the original `deepseek` and `Hailuo AI` integrations, as their official free access is no longer available.

We sincerely appreciate all your support— the development and maintenance of this plugin rely on user feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to contact us if you encounter any issues or have any recommendations during use.
